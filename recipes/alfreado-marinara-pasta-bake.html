        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This comforting pasta bake features fettuccine coated in a rosy pink sauce, a perfect blend of marinara and alfredo. 
            The sauce is cheesy without being overly rich, brightened by the tomatoes. This true "dump and bake" dish requires no pre-boiling, 
            and a final broil creates a slightly browned, crisp topping. 
            It's a simple, luxurious, and deeply satisfying meal.
