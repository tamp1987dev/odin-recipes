        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This one-pot tomato sausage pasta could not be more family-friendly. It features minimal prep and cleanup, and is ready in well under an hour. Simmering the pasta directly in marinara sauce makes a thick, hearty dish.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
            <li>11 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>11/2 white onion, minced</li>
            <li>13 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>11 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons red wine</li>
            <li>11 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce, such as Mutti's®</li>
            <li>18 ounces penne pasta</li>
            <li>12 cups hot water</li>
            <li>1salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Melt butter with olive oil in a large heavy sauce pot or non-reactive Dutch oven over medium-low heat.</li> 
            <li>Add onion and cook, stirring frequently until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir just until fragrant. Add sausage and cook, breaking up with spatula, until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan with wine and stir to incorporate. Mix in marinara sauce. Bring to a simmer and simmer gently for about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir dry pasta into simmering sauce and cook 5 minutes more, then pour in 1 cup water. Test pasta for doneness; stir in remaining water.</li>
            <li>Continue to simmer and stir frequently to prevent pasta sticking to the bottom of the pot. Test the pasta and cook until done to your liking.</li> 
            <li>Serve in a wide bowl with a sprinkling of cheese. </li>
        </ol>
