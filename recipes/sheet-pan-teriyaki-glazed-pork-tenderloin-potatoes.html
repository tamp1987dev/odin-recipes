        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This sheet pan dinner of teriyaki glazed pork tenderloin, potatoes, and green beans is as easy as it gets. The resting time at the end is important—it's what keeps the pork juicy.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds small potatoes, cut in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup teriyaki glaze</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with foil. Place tenderloins in the center of the baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. </li>
                <li>Place oil, potatoes, and green beans in a large mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Arrange vegetables around tenderloins. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove baking sheet from the oven and baste both tenderloins with teriyaki glaze. </li>
                <li>Place the sheet back in the oven until tenderloins are no longer pink at the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center of pork should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven, tent pork with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>        
            </ol>
